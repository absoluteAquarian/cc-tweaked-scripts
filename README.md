# cc-tweaked-scripts
A collection of Lua scripts for the Minecraft mod, CC: Tweaked.

The general-purpose installer for this repository's scripts can be executed using the following in a Computer's shell:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/absoluteAquarian/cc-tweaked-scripts/main/installer.lua installer.lua
```

## Development
The suggested environment for developing these scripts involves using **Visual Studio Code** along with these extensions:
- [Lua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) for autocomplete, error reporting, text highlighting and more
- [ComputerCraft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jackmacwindows.vscode-computercraft) for the global CraftOS definitions and autocomplete for its functions

Plus, adding the text from [this Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/fVTvu4Bw) to the JSON Settings (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) at the top of the file after the first `{`.
